Simply put this ending will trigger if you DO NOT enter the captains office.\n\nEnding 2-6:\n\nSolve the captains riddle and then enter the CPU. The 5 endings you can get here depend on the last few things you say to Amy, and are pretty simple to unlock one by one (using your browsers back button).\n\nEnding 7:\n\nThis ending is my favorite one. It also explains a lot of Amy's motivation and fills in a lot of blanks in the story.\n\nYou’ll need to get inside the security room before you enter Amy’s CPU.\n\nI’ll drop a hint on how to unlock it, and if that doesn’t help, I’ll simply write out how to access it.\n\nWhen you reboot Amy during Endings 2 to 6, those numbers that fly across the screen - They’re important. They’re the key to unlocking this ending. 0s and 1s. What is it called when a bunch of 0s and 1s are together?\n\nHow to get ending 7 -\n\nFair enough. It’s pretty tricky. What you need to do is to copy the binary (the 0s and 1s) that you see on Amy’s screen when she reboots into a binary to text converter. Such as this one here:\n\nhttp://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp\n\nWhen you do that you’ll get the access code to the captains computer.\n\nIf you’re still stuck:\n\nCaptains Terminal Override Password: 482246\n\nAmy Logs Access Code: 924143\n\nEnter the terminal override password first and then the Amy log access code.\n\nRead Amy’s logs and she’ll reveal the password to the security room.\n\nFINAL HINT YOU SHOULDN’T NEED\n\nThe password to the security room is Metempsychosis\n\nShe mentions it in her last log.\n\nEnter the security room to trigger the last ending.\n\n[[EXTRAS|Extras]]\n\n[[HINTS]]\n\n\n[[Back to the start|Start]]</div><div tiddler="LiftMainArea" tags="" created="201403110043" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,3090">You step out into the new area.

Some of her best lines can be totally missed. Check the lift, go to the CPU look out into space, ect ect.\n\nBefore you go into the CPU Amy has three or so lines to try and convince you not to enter, you just have to select the Wait and see what Amy has to say option.\n\nIf you do not solve the first puzzle, it does not stop you from getting all the endings, but it does change the dialogue you receive from Amy. If you do complete it, you get different dialogue when you stare out into space from the bridge, when you attempt to access the Captain’s office, when you find the dead men outside the CPU and you get a unique line of voice dialogue when Amy is talking to you . This occurs when you pick up the grenade. If you listened to the audio logs you get a dialogue regarding the deck masters affair, if you didn’t, there is no dialogue here.\n\nIf you play the guitar at least once, Amy has a different line of dialogue when you smash the guitar on the glass. If you haven’t played the guitar and you smash it she’ll say something different - so there’s actually three possible outcomes - smash with a book - smash with guitar (dialogue 1) and smash with guitar (dialogue 2).\n\nWhen Amy asks you where you are from/ if you have family, each choice leads to a few unique dialogue options. Specifically when you are looking out into space on the bridge, and a voiced dialogue option later. For each choice, Earth, Space or don’t remember you get a unique piece of voice dialogue when you enter the bridge in your spacesuit.\n\nIf you don’t check the destroyed droid on the bridge at all, you get unique text when you acquire the grenade. Instead of recalling what Amy said about EMP’s you remember yourself what they do. \n\n\nIf you attempt to enter the security corridor, Amy will note that you really should be heading for her CPU, If you decide not to enter  the security corridor, but then attempt to enter it again, you get a different line of dialogue. \n\nEntering the CPU corridor after Amy turns off the air but before you have the grenade gives you a few fun pieces of dialogue. \n\nMost players will never come across these little nuances, but I have placed them there to make the text feel more organic for those that do.\n\nIf you checked everything you would have already seen this but I’ll mention it anyway:\n\nAfter you get into the spacesuit, if you try to access security, Amy will ask you a knock knock joke that you can answer and get a response to.\n\nFUN FACTS  / BITS AND BOBS\n\nIf you take all of Amy’s dialogue and play it from start to finish it clocks in at about 35 minutes. That’s all of it including the endings.\n\nIf you add ?debug to the address bar of the game and press enter, the game will list all variables that are being passed across, you can do this to see how many are being passed around. There’s quite a few.\n\nAMY got her name from that scary irish lady from the kindle adverts. The one with a serious “Candy crush saga addiction” \n\nI’m pretty sure Amy is the only AI ever voiced with a Bristolian accent, but props to my flatmate, she got really into it. I was actually pretty scared by her for a few days after recording.\n\nThe songs I butcher on the guitar are:\n\nPoets of the Fall - Late Goodbye\nDandy Warhols - Godless\nPoets of the Fall - Carnival of Rust\n\n[[HINTS]]\n\n[[ENDINGS]]\n\n\n[[Back to the start|Start]]</div><div tiddler="Window Into Space Death" tags="" created="201403222203" modifier="twee" twine-position="290,5890">&lt;&lt;stopallsound&gt;&gt; \n&lt;&lt;playsound &quot;Annoying Noises 45.mp3&quot; &gt;&gt;\n\nYou stare out into space, admiring the vastness of the cosmos.
