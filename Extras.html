Extras! 

Little bits you many have missed.

When you get the spacesuit on go everywhere you can BEFORE you pick up the grenade to get all of Amy’s spoken dialogue. Some of her best lines can be totally missed. Check the lift, go to the CPU look out into space, ect ect.

Before you go into the CPU Amy has three or so lines to try and convince you not to enter, you just have to select the Wait and see what Amy has to say option.

If you do not solve the first puzzle, it does not stop you from getting all the endings, but it does change the dialogue you receive from Amy. If you do complete it, you get different dialogue when you stare out into space from the bridge, when you attempt to access the Captain’s office, when you find the dead men outside the CPU and you get a unique line of voice dialogue when Amy is talking to you . This occurs when you pick up the grenade. If you listened to the audio logs you get a dialogue regarding the deck masters affair, if you didn’t, there is no dialogue here.

If you play the guitar at least once, Amy has a different line of dialogue when you smash the guitar on the glass. If you haven’t played the guitar and you smash it she’ll say something different - so there’s actually three possible outcomes - smash with a book - smash with guitar (dialogue 1) and smash with guitar (dialogue 2).

When Amy asks you where you are from/ if you have family, each choice leads to a few unique dialogue options. Specifically when you are looking out into space on the bridge, and a voiced dialogue option later. For each choice, Earth, Space or don’t remember you get a unique piece of voice dialogue when you enter the bridge in your spacesuit.

If you don’t check the destroyed droid on the bridge at all, you get unique text when you acquire the grenade. Instead of recalling what Amy said about EMP’s you remember yourself what they do. 


If you attempt to enter the security corridor, Amy will note that you really should be heading for her CPU, If you decide not to enter  the security corridor, but then attempt to enter it again, you get a different line of dialogue. 

Entering the CPU corridor after Amy turns off the air but before you have the grenade gives you a few fun pieces of dialogue. 

Most players will never come across these little nuances, but I have placed them there to make the text feel more organic for those that do.

If you checked everything you would have already seen this but I’ll mention it anyway:

After you get into the spacesuit, if you try to access security, Amy will ask you a knock knock joke that you can answer and get a response to.

FUN FACTS  / BITS AND BOBS

If you take all of Amy’s dialogue and play it from start to finish it clocks in at about 35 minutes. That’s all of it including the endings.

If you add ?debug to the address bar of the game and press enter, the game will list all variables that are being passed across, you can do this to see how many are being passed around. There’s quite a few.

AMY got her name from that scary irish lady from the kindle adverts. The one with a serious “Candy crush saga addiction” 

I’m pretty sure Amy is the only AI ever voiced with a Bristolian accent, but props to my flatmate, she got really into it. I was actually pretty scared by her for a few days after recording.

The songs I butcher on the guitar are:

Poets of the Fall - Late Goodbye
Dandy Warhols - Godless
Poets of the Fall - Carnival of Rust
