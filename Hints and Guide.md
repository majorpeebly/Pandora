Hints

Very basic hints will be given first, then overt hints. Finally, the answer to the puzzle will be presented to you.

DECKMASTER COMPUTER PASSWORD

The hint reads:

Password = my kids + the words on my left arm 

Looks like it’s a sum…

START OVERT HINT

The picture of the kids seems like a good place to start. How many kids does he have? 

Then you need to check the body for his tattoo. There’s no numbers in the tattoo. How can we add words?

END OVERT HINT

FULL SOLUTION

The deck master has 3 kids. So that’s our first number. The tattoo reads: NO GODS OR KINGS, ONLY MEN. That’s 6 words. 3 plus 6 = 9. The answer is 9.

END SOLUTION
