Endings.

Here is how to gain access to all seven endings to Pandora.

Ending 1:

To trigger ending 1, enter Amy’s CPU without completing the Captain’s riddle. Simply put this ending will trigger if you DO NOT enter the captains office.

Ending 2-6:

Solve the captains riddle and then enter the CPU. The 5 endings you can get here depend on the last few things you say to Amy, and are pretty simple to unlock one by one (using your browsers back button)

Ending 7:

This ending is my favorite one. It also explains a lot of Amy's motivation and fills in a lot of blanks in the story.

You’ll need to get inside the security room before you enter Amy’s CPU.
 
I’ll drop a hint on how to unlock it, and if that doesn’t help, I’ll simply write out how to access it.

When you reboot Amy during Endings 2 to 6, those numbers that fly across the screen - They’re important. They’re the key to unlocking this ending. 0s and 1s. What is it called when a bunch of 0s and 1s are together?

How to get ending 7 - 

Fair enough. It’s pretty tricky. What you need to do is to copy the binary (the 0s and 1s) that you see on Amy’s screen when she reboots into a binary to text converter. Such as this one here:

When you do that you’ll get the access code to the captains computer.

If you’re still stuck:

Captains Terminal Override Password: 482246

Amy Logs Access Code: 924143

Enter the terminal override password first and then the Amy log access code. 

Read Amy’s logs and she’ll reveal the password to the security room. 


FINAL HINT YOU SHOULDN’T NEED

The password to the security room is Metempsychosis 

She mentions it in her last log.

Enter the security room to trigger the last ending.
